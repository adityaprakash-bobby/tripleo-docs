Scaling overcloud roles
=======================
If you want to increase or decrease resource capacity of a running overcloud,
you can start more servers of a selected role or delete some servers if
capacity should be decreased. To set the capacity for the compute role,
first an environment file should be created::

    $ cat ~/environment.yaml
    parameter_defaults:
    Â  ComputeCount: 5

Then following command can be used to deploy it::

    openstack overcloud deploy --templates [templates dir] \
      -e <full environment> -e ~/environment.yaml

.. note::
   It is especially important to remember that you **must** include all
   environment files that were used to deploy the overcloud. Make sure
   you pass those in addition to your customization environments at the
   end (`environment.yaml`).

.. note::
   Scaling out assumes that newly added nodes has already been
   registered in Ironic.

.. note::
   When scaling down random servers of specified role will be deleted, how to
   delete specific nodes is described in :ref:`delete_nodes`.

.. note::
   The different scale parameters can be seen in the output of::

       openstack help overcloud deploy
