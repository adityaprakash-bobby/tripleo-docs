.. This should be changed to something more user-friendly like http://tripleo.org/tripleo-repos.rpm

Download and install the python2-tripleo-repos RPM from
`the current RDO repository <https://trunk.rdoproject.org/centos7/current/>`_.
For example::

    sudo yum install -y https://trunk.rdoproject.org/centos7/current/python2-tripleo-repos-<version>.el7.centos.noarch.rpm

.. note:: tripleo-repos removes any repositories that it manages before each
          run.  This means all repositories must be specified in a single
          tripleo-repos call.  As an example, the correct way to install the
          current and ceph repos is to run ``tripleo-repos current ceph``,
          not two separate calls.
