.. This should be changed to something more user-friendly like http://tripleo.org/tripleo-repos.rpm

Download and install the python2-tripleo-repos RPM from
`the current RDO repository <https://trunk.rdoproject.org/centos7/current/>`_.
For example

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo yum install -y https://trunk.rdoproject.org/centos7/current/python2-tripleo-repos-<version>.el7.centos.noarch.rpm

.. note::

   tripleo-repos removes any repositories that it manages before each run.
   This means all repositories must be specified in a single tripleo-repos
   call. As an example, the correct way to install the current and ceph repos
   is to run ``tripleo-repos current ceph``, not two separate calls.
