Virtual Environment
-------------------

|project| can be used in a virtual environment using virtual machines instead
of actual baremetal. However, one baremetal machine is still
needed to act as the host for the virtual machines.

.. warning:: Virtual deployments with TripleO are for development and testing
             purposes only.  This method cannot be used for production-ready
             deployments.

The tripleo-quickstart project is used for creating virtual environments
for use with TripleO. Please see that documentation at
https://docs.openstack.org/developer/tripleo-quickstart/
